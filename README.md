__Things to know:__

- The snake moves continuously in the direction that it is facing, so don't forget to hit another arrow key before it either runs into itself or the wall!
- The snake's length increases each time it consumes food, so your goal is to eat as much as you can!

__How to run the program:__

1. Open up the source code in an IDE.
2. Navigate to the main file (Game.Java)
3. Make sure the main method is present (if commented out, please uncomment it)
4. Hit the "run" button.

__How to play the game:__

1. Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. Locate the food object placed randomly on the game board.
3. Control the snake via the arrow keys (up, right, down, left) towards the grid containing the food.
4. Collect as many pieces of food possible to grow your snake WITHOUT running into itself or running into the board's boundaries.
