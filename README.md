# $${\color{pink}Snake!}$$

## __Product Description__

Our team created a replica of the popular interactive Snake game. When the user runs the algorithm, the gameboard immediately pops up within a canvas window with the initial snake and food object generated inside the grid. 

The objective of Snake is to control a snake that moves around a two-dimensional playing field or grid. The snake starts as a short segment and must eat food items scattered throughout the playing area to grow longer. The primary challenge is to avoid running into the walls of the playing field and, more importantly, the snake's own tail. Players score points each time the snake eats a piece of food. The longer the snake, the higher the score.

***

> Technical Requirements: Java 17 and a Java-friendly IDE (we used VS Code) installed.

__Things to know:__

- The snake moves continuously in the direction that it is facing, so don't forget to hit another arrow key before it either runs into itself or the wall!
- The snake's length increases each time it consumes food, so your goal is to eat as much as you can!

__How to run the program:__

1. Open up the source code in an IDE.
2. Navigate to the main file (Game.Java)
3. Make sure the main method is present (if commented out, please uncomment it)
4. Hit the "run" button.

__How to play the game:__

1. Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. Locate the food object placed randomly on the game board.
3. Control the snake via the arrow keys (up, right, down, left) towards the grid containing the food.
4. Collect as many pieces of food possible to grow your snake WITHOUT running into itself or running into the board's boundaries.

## __Goals:__

Our team intends to create an exact replica of Snake. The project's core goals include successfully implementing all of the original game details (Snake needs to eat food, snake cannot run off the board, snake can't run into itself, etc.) as well as using what we learned this semester in Data Structures to do it. Peripheral goals include implementing an extra aspect into the game where the snake loses segments of itself after a certain amount of time without eating food. If there is enough time towards the end, we will also focus on upgrading the UI and user experience. The biggest goal for our team is to successfully showcase the skills and knowledge we have learned throughout CS128 in a self-driven project.
