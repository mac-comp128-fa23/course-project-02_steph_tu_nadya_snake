# SNAKE!

## __Group Members: Stephanie Miles, Tu Tran, and Nadya Konadu__

## __Product Description__

Our team created a replica of the popular interactive Snake game. When the user runs the algorithm, the gameboard immediately pops up within a canvas window with the initial snake and food object generated inside the grid. The objective of Snake is to control a snake that moves around a two-dimensional playing field or grid. The snake starts as a short segment and must eat food items scattered throughout the playing area to grow longer. The primary challenge is to avoid running into the walls of the playing field and, more importantly, the snake's own tail. Players score points each time the snake eats a piece of food. The longer the snake, the higher the score.

> Technical Requirements: Java 17 and a Java-friendly IDE (we used VS Code) installed.

__Things to know:__

- The snake moves continuously in the direction that it is facing, so don't forget to hit another arrow key before it either runs into itself or the wall!
- The snake's length increases each time it consumes food, so your goal is to eat as much as you can!

__How to run the program:__

1. Open up the source code in an IDE.
2. Navigate to the main file (Game.Java)
3. Make sure the main method is present (if commented out, please uncomment it)
4. Hit the "run" button.

__How to play the game:__

1. Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. Locate the food object placed randomly on the game board.
3. Control the snake via the arrow keys (up, right, down, left) towards the grid containing the food.
4. Collect as many pieces of food possible to grow your snake WITHOUT running into itself or running into the board's boundaries.
